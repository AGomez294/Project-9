# Honeypot Assignment

**Time spent:** **5** hours spent in total

**Objective:** Create a honeynet using MHN-Admin. Present your findings as if you were requested to give a brief report of the current state of Internet security. Assume that your audience is a current employer who is questioning why the company should allocate anymore resources to the IT security team.

### MHN-Admin Deployment (Required)

**Summary:** How did you deploy it? Did you use GCP, AWS, Azure, Vagrant, VirtualBox, etc.?

I deployed MHN-Admin through GCP. The entire process was done through my laptop's command prompt. Steps were taken to ensure that each command was inserted and executed correctly at each step of the way.

### Dionaea Honeypot Deployment (Required)

**Summary:** Briefly in your own words, what does dionaea do?

Dionaea attracts bots from all over the world which attempt to attack the honeypot. Dionaea then gains information of its place of origin.

### Database Backup (Required) 

**Summary:** What is the RDBMS that MHN-Admin uses? What information does the exported JSON file record?

*Be sure to upload session.json directly to this GitHub repo/branch in order to get full credit.*

Unfortunately, after 4 hours of having it up and making a couple of more attempts, my honeypot did not recieve any attacks and therefore there was no .json file to extract.

### Deploying Additional Honeypot(s) (Optional)

#### X Honeypot

**Summary:** What does this honeypot simulate and do for a security researcher?
